# Social Media Promo Scheduler — Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview
Next.js 16 app (forked from LateWiz) for automated social media campaign generation and scheduling. Takes a URL (exhibition, blog post, artist page) and generates a 6-month promotional campaign with tapering frequency. Uses Zernio API for social media scheduling, Airtable for data storage and approval workflows.

## Rule 1: Read code before answering

**NEVER answer questions about how something works from memory alone.** Read every file in the chain first. The code is the source of truth.

## Rule 2: GitHub Issues are the source of truth

**When a design or feature is discussed:** Create a GitHub issue immediately with the full spec. Design documents belong in GitHub Issues, not in conversation history.

**When closing an issue:** Add a comment summarising what was built and which files changed.

## Rule 3: Never ask the user to do what you can do yourself

CLI tools are pre-approved: `git`, `gh`, `npm`, `npx`, `node`, `python3`, `curl`, `vercel`, `lsof`, `kill`, `jq`, `open`, `tree`.
Airtable schema changes: use the Meta API directly, never ask the user to edit Airtable manually.

## Rule 4: Use Perplexity for ALL research — NEVER use WebSearch or WebFetch

**All research tasks must use the Perplexity MCP tools** (`search`, `reason`, or `deep_research`). Do NOT use the WebSearch or WebFetch tools — they are unreliable and the user does not trust them. This includes research launched via subagents — subagents must also use Perplexity, not WebSearch/WebFetch.

When delegating research to an Agent subagent, explicitly instruct it to use Perplexity MCP tools and NOT WebSearch/WebFetch.

## Rule 5: Execute ALL user instructions in a single pass

When the user gives multiple instructions in one message, implement ALL of them before responding. Do not silently drop instructions.

## Rule 6: Visual testing with Puppeteer is mandatory when requested

When the user says "testing suite", "test visually", "take a screenshot", "use Puppeteer", or any variation — this is a **BLOCKING requirement**. Do not proceed without it.

**What this means:**
- After UI changes: load the page in Puppeteer, screenshot the relevant area, READ the screenshot, evaluate it
- After generating images: open each image via Puppeteer, screenshot it, READ the screenshot, critique it
- If issues found: fix and re-test. Do NOT present to the user until it passes visual review
- TypeScript compilation passing does NOT count as visual testing
- Reading a file inline does NOT count as visual testing
- "Looks good based on the code" is NOT acceptable — visual output must be visually verified

**How to use Puppeteer** (already installed as `puppeteer@24.40.0`):
```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('http://localhost:3025/dashboard/...');
await page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/screenshot.png', fullPage: true });
await browser.close();
```
Then READ the screenshot file to evaluate it visually.

**This rule exists because:** Visual testing was repeatedly skipped despite explicit user requests, causing the user to find bugs manually (calendar overflow, image off-by-one, template text overlap). This is not acceptable.

## Zernio API

- **Base URL:** `https://zernio.com/api`
- **Auth:** Bearer token (`sk_` prefixed), stored in `LATE_API_KEY` env var
- **SDK:** `@getlatedev/node` (npm package)
- **CLI:** `@zernio/cli` (global install)
- **Key endpoints:** See `docs/zernio-api-openapi.yaml`
- **Rate limits:** Vary by plan (Free: 60/min, Build: 120/min)
- **Response shape:** `createPost` returns `{ post: { _id: "..." }, message: "..." }` — the post ID is nested under `.post._id`, NOT at the top level `._id`. Always extract via `data.post._id`.
- **Campaign-relevant features:**
  - Per-platform `customContent` and `customMedia` per post
  - Per-platform `scheduledFor` overrides
  - Post recycling with content variations (weekly/monthly)
  - Queue system with recurring time slots
  - Bulk CSV upload
  - Webhooks for post lifecycle events

## Airtable

- **Base ID:** `app5FPCG06huzh7hX`
- **PAT:** stored in `.env.local` as `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` (prefix `patO7R...`)
- **Base URL:** https://airtable.com/app5FPCG06huzh7hX/
- **Meta API:** `GET/PATCH https://api.airtable.com/v0/meta/bases/{baseId}/tables` — for schema changes
- **Never ask the user to manually create/modify fields in the Airtable UI.** Use the REST API or write a script.

### Tables

| Table | ID | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Brands | `tblK6tDXvx8Qt0CXh` | Brand profiles, voice guidelines, logos, Zernio profile links |
| Campaigns | `tbl4S3vdDR4JgBT1d` | Campaign config (URL, type, duration, bias, editorial direction, og:image, event date, event details, additional URLs, target platforms, max variants per platform). **Scraped Images** (JSON array of `{url, alt, storyTitle?}`) populated during generation — surfaced in post editor as campaign image library |
| Posts | `tblyUEPOJXxpQDZNL` | Generated post drafts per platform, approval status (Draft/Approved/Dismissed), scheduling status (Queued/Scheduled/Published). **Image Upload** attachment field for per-post image swap/override. **imageIndex** (integer) for catalog-based image selection, **subject** field declares who/what each post is about |
| Platform Settings | `tbl3CXqVmk4GVkmQn` | 13 records: character limits, URL handling, tone per platform |
| Image Sizes | `tbl1gXZgmKzfLH2X5` | 29 records: image dimensions per platform per image type |
| Campaign Type Rules | `tblh0R7a5PyNZXt2Y` | 11 records: type definitions, descriptions, icons, status, scraper strategy (includes "Open Call" — Coming Soon) |
| Generation Rules | `tbliTMGAEuaU9CLBf` | Editorial rules per campaign type, composed into prompt fragments |
| Feedback Log | `tblZWSKDdVYUcHX5J` | Structured feedback on generated posts, linked to posts/campaigns/types |
| Cover Slide Templates | `tblk0l8nE9SDP0lca` | Band-based layout templates for carousel cover slides (JSON spec, color scheme, fonts, brand/type associations) |
| Users | `tblyUmt78haC25nPZ` | User-to-brand access mapping: email, role, allowed brands, default brand |

### Source base (read-only reference)
- `appDFU2JdAw2Ckax4` — Artwork Archive campaigns base (brand logos in Campaigns table)
- `appa1MQoMsfZ0WCPu` — Platform Settings + Image Sizes source (cloned from here)

## Existing n8n Workflows (reference only, not extending)

- `ptljiEPKOXED850E` — "First Fridays Exhibition Importer & Enhancer V2" — scrapes exhibitions, classifies artworks, profiles artists
- `wbb8rik5kgcDVFIE` — "First Fridays Promo Pack Generator" — AI carousel content + Orshot rendering
- Airtable: `app7fpZnDmqgPxQPV` — legacy exhibition/artwork/artist data

## Conventions

- Use shadcn/ui components from `components/ui/`
- Use `cn()` from `lib/utils.ts` for class merging
- App Router only (no pages/ directory)
- All AI prompts must follow the XML-tag prompt architecture from global CLAUDE.md
- **Image catalog approach:** Claude selects images by `imageIndex` from a numbered catalog. Works across all CMS platforms (Ghost, BigCommerce, WordPress, etc.). Multi-section blog posts use section headings as image labels when alt text is empty.
- **Image-Text Integrity Rule:** Constraint hierarchy — editorial direction cannot override integrity rules. Claude must not guess names, attribute artwork to wrong artists, or fabricate attribution. This is enforced in prompt templates.
- **Image filtering:** Thumbnails <200px in URL paths are rejected. Dimension-aware dedup keeps the largest version. Supplemental URL images are filtered by entity overlap with the main URL content.
- **lnk.bio integration:** After Instagram posts are published, a lnk.bio entry is auto-created with the campaign's source URL. Currently hardcoded for The Intersect brand (group ID 68052). Per-brand config tracked in #68.
- **Zernio webhook:** `POST /api/webhooks/zernio` receives post lifecycle events and syncs status to Airtable. Auth middleware bypassed for `/api/webhooks` path. Currently registered via ngrok; permanent URL tracked in #67.
- **LinkedIn PDF carousel:** Posts with 2+ images targeting LinkedIn are auto-assembled into a PDF at publish time using `pdf-lib`. PDF uploaded to Zernio as document media type.
- **Cover slide designer:** Optional editorial cover slide prepended to carousel posts. Uses a horizontal band layout engine (Satori + Sharp) with Airtable-driven templates. AI generates text from post/campaign context. User can adjust font sizes, pick background colors via eyedropper, reposition the background image. Templates in Cover Slide Templates table (`tblk0l8nE9SDP0lca`). Cover slide uses the original raw image (from Original Media backup), not rendered slides. Supports additive card creation via `insertPosition: "append"` — new cards append to carousel without displacing the existing cover at position 0.
- **Image selectors:** Outpainting and card creation use image selector dialogs (`OutpaintImageSelector`, `CardImageSelector`) that filter out designed cards via `CoverSlideData.designedCardUrls`. Shared filtering utility: `getEligibleOutpaintIndices()` in `media-items.ts`. Single eligible image skips the selector.
- **Campaign image library:** Scraped images from campaign generation are surfaced as a clickable thumbnail row when adding images to posts (`CampaignImageLibrary` component). Alt text from scraping auto-fills captions — especially valuable for exhibitions with rich attribution. Data source: `Scraped Images` field on Campaigns table.

## Session Rules

1. **Read code before answering.** Do not answer from memory.
2. **Execute ALL user instructions.** Do not silently drop any.
3. **Convert timestamps to ET.** Zernio API timestamps are UTC. User is in America/New_York.
4. **Save important discoveries to memory immediately.** Do not wait until end of session.

## Post-Commit Checklist (MANDATORY after every commit)

After every `git commit`, run through this checklist before responding to the user. This is not optional.

### 1. GitHub Issues
- **Scan ALL open issues** (`gh issue list --state open`). For each one, ask: does this commit fully or partially resolve it?
- **Fully resolved:** Close with a comment listing what was built and which files changed.
- **Partially resolved:** Add a comment describing what was done and what remains. Do NOT close.
- **New work discussed but untracked:** Create an issue immediately. Design discussions, feature ideas, and bugs mentioned in conversation must not live only in chat history.
- **Follow-up work from partial closures:** Create a new issue referencing the original.
- **Never close an issue just because it was discussed.** Only close when the described implementation exists in the codebase.

### 2. README.md
- Does the README's "Project Status" checklist reflect what was just built?
- Do the architecture descriptions still match reality? (e.g., new routes, new tables, new components)
- Are any new third-party integrations mentioned? (e.g., Firecrawl scraping on campaign creation)

### 3. CLAUDE.md
- Does the Project Structure tree reflect new directories/files?
- Are new Airtable tables/fields documented in the Airtable section?
- Are new API routes or conventions captured?

### 4. GETTING_STARTED.md
- Are phase status indicators current? (e.g., Phase I tasks marked as done)
- Do the task tables reflect completed work?

### 5. Only commit and push when explicitly asked
- Do NOT commit or push proactively.
- When the user says "push", "commit", or "document and push": commit, push, AND run this full checklist.
- If the user asks "are we up to date?" — report status but do not push until told to.
